# When Should I Fuzz?

A pertinent question might be when is the right time to fuzz? Should I fuzz during development, after I release, at the beginning of a sprint, or at
the end of the release cycle? The short answer is “all of the above.” You should fuzz at a minimum after a feature or a set of features has been
completed from a development perspective. This practical approach applies to both existing products and new product releases.  

As we have mentioned before, fuzzing is complementary to traditional testing, as it uncovers many security vulnerabilities and defects. Fuzzing should
therefore be considered a validation time activity within the software development life cycle (SDLC.) Even within Microsoft’s [Security Development Lifecycle](https://download.microsoft.com/download/B/8/2/B8282D75-433C-4B7E-B0A0-FFA413E20060/microsoft_security_development_lifecycle.pdf) (SDL) fuzzing is 
listed under the verification phase of the SDL.
